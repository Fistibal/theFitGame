            <h1>Welcome to the Fit Challenge</h1>
            <h3>Game Rules</h3>
            <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
                - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to the other player ROUND score
                - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all the other player ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
                - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that the other player ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
                - The first player to add 100 points on the other player GLOBAL score wins the game.
                - The loser has to do the random exercise challenge.
